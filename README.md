Cruthaich
=========

A development tool to help you create web-based database applications. Written in PHP and MySQL.
Released under an MIT Licence.

We aim to make the best tool for creating web-based database applications: we aim high!

Cruthaich is the Scottish Gaelic word for create and is pronounced croo-eech (ch as in Scottish loch).


Project Status
--------------

We're still defining the scope and aims of the project.  Perfect time to join if you want to get in at the start
and help set the direction.

- Working on the first prototype (this will be version 0.1.0)
  This will be very limited in scope in order that we can get a first proof of concept
  completed and released as quickly as possible.  The plan is to have frequent releases
  with functionality increasing as we go.  Our target is to use Cruthaich to build
  future versions of itself.
- Application design being firmed up.
- Prototype MySQL database generation plugin written.
- Application database model done.


Planned Freatures
-----------------

- Define the application
- Generate the database tables to the required technology (MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, etc.)
- Generate the server scripts in the required language (PHP, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Everthing is versioned, with forking and merging
- Testing is built in, allowing automatic regression testing
- Full lifecycle support, from requirements to post production releases
- Issue and bug tracking
- Create REST web services on tables and views at the click of a button


Project Approach
----------------

Release early and often.  We're working towards getting a minimal prototype working.  After that we will gradually
extend it and enrich it.


Planned for First Release
-------------------------

Candidate features for version 0.1.0 (not finalised):
  - Basic MySQL database generator (tables only)
  - Basic PHP application generator (minimal item types)
  - Versioning support
  - Test script definition, execution and exception logging
  - Issue tracking
