Cruthaich
=========

A development tool to help you create web-based database applications. Written in PHP and MySQL.

Cruthaich is the Scottish Gaelic word for create and is pronounced crooth-eech (ch as in Scottish loch).


Project Status
--------------

We're still defining the scope and aims of the project.  Perfect time to join if you want to get in at the start
and help set the direction.


Planned Freatures
-----------------

- Define the application
- Generate the database tables to the required technology (MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, etc.)
- Generate the server scripts in the required language (PHP, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Everthing is versioned
- Testing is built in, allowing automatic regression testing
- Requirements tracking
- Issue tracking
- Release management


Project Approach
----------------

Release early and often.  We're working towards getting a minimal prototype working.  After that we will gradually
extend it and enrich it.
